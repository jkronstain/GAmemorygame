	<p>REMEMBER THIS!, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
		
	<p>Invented by Kermit the Frog himself, REMEMBER THIS! was born out of love. Kermit and Miss Piggy (yes, they're back together - again!) agreed that, as they aged, they needed a mechanism to help them keep their brains sharp and their tongues even sharper. <a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_News_Flash">Click here to keep up with Kermit and the whole fuzzy gang!</a> </p>
